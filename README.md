# Movie Explorer API

## Overview

The Movie Explorer API provides endpoints to manage users and their favorite movies. It supports operations such as retrieving user data, adding movies to a userâ€™s favorites, updating movie information, and deleting movies from the list. Additionally, it offers movie recommendations using OpenAI's API based on a selected movie. Designed with scalability and maintainability in mind, this API is built using Node.js, Express, and Sequelize.
